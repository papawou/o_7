<Lobby />
    socket.on('joinLobby')
        case -> if two tabs are opens same account
        effect -> same members duplicated
        wanted -> one member

    solution -> 1) prevent addmember if already same member
             -> 2) BACKEND: prevent Socketio emit.joinLobby if already user in lobby (* best performance)
