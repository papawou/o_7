SOCKETIO /lobbys
    on('disconnect')
        case -> two tabs open same accounts
        effect -> lobby deleted
               -> emit.leaveLobby
        wanted -> lobby not deleted if stay socket open user
               -> emit.leaveLobby only if no socket stay open from user

        solutions -> 1) use REDIS to link id_user with sockets
                  -> 2) use SocketIo to check if stay one user in room (* most simple, and reusable. best perf ?)
